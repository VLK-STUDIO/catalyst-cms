I kept the snarky tone because the level of my frustration has increased over the years, and I donâ€™t want to pretend that the situation isnâ€™t as dire as it really is. Most of all I am frustrated to see all the people for whom this is the first programming experience, as well as all the people who are blocked from deploying their changes due to irrelevant warnings.
